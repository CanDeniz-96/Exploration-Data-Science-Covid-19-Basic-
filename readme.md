## By Can Deniz Balkaya
In this repo, I try to explore some information from the owid-covid-data.csv taken from Kaggle.

### Steps:
- Understand the structure of data.
- Take datas belong to 02/10/2022
- Remove columns having null values higher than %40 of the total rows.
- Create new dataset from wanted columns
- Fill the rest of empty columns with mean of those.
- Get Correlation between the columns.
- Drow a heatmap.
