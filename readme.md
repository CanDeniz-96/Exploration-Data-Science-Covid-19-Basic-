### Steps:

- 1. Understand the structure of data.
- 2. Take datas belong to 02/10/2022
- 3. Remove columns having null values higher than %40 of the total rows.
- 4. Create new dataset from wanted columns
- 5. Fill the rest of empty columns with mean of those.
- 6. Get Correlation between the columns.
- 7. Drow a heatmap.
